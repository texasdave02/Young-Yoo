# HOS01A: Cloud Development Environment

## Purpose of this section

The purpose of this section is to learn how to access and use GitHub Codespaces as a cloud based development environment. By practicing this section, I became familiar with opening my assignment repository in Codespaces, using the integrated terminal, running basic commands such as `npm init`, and viewing files in the explorer.

This practice helps me understand how to set up my development workspace properly so that I can complete future coding assignments and push my work to GitHub correctly and efficiently. In short, the goal of this section is to make sure I am comfortable using GitHub Codespaces as the main environment for writing, testing, and submitting my code.
