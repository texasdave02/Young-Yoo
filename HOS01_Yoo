# Codespaces Lab — Setup Summary

Purpose
- Practice accessing and using GitHub Codespaces as a cloud development environment.
- Become familiar with opening the assignment repository in Codespaces, using the integrated terminal, running basic commands (e.g., `npm init`), and viewing files in the explorer.
- Prepare a development workspace for completing and submitting future assignments through GitHub.

Steps performed
1. Opened the assignment repository in GitHub Codespaces.
2. Launched the integrated terminal inside the Codespace.
3. Initialized a minimal Node.js project:
    ```
    npm init -y
    ```
4. Explored files and workspace in the editor explorer and terminal:
    ```
    ls -la
    git status
    ```
5. Verified the workspace is ready for development (node modules, package.json present).

Outcome
- Confirmed ability to open and operate a Codespace, use the terminal, run basic setup commands, and inspect files in the explorer.
- Workspace is prepared for subsequent assignment development and submission.
